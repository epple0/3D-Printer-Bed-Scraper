Total time: 4.3 hours; Tier 5 Project

Final touches <br>
Made some final touches to the project as a whole. Added to the repo and made renders. This part did not have any problems, as I just had to express my creativity and get it done.

This is the final copy, I added an engraving of the name of this program, Blueprint. I think it turned out great!

Final:

These were the renders:

That's all. Thank you!


Polished Things up<br>
Worked on some design features to make the thing more aesthetically pleasing while retaining the original function. I really struggled with how to make a cool pattern, as I originally wanted a honeycomb like pattern, but found that really difficult even with online tutorials. I tried a few different things and settled for these 2 patterns (Shown below) but decided on the one with the larger gap to save filament and for a cleaner, more polished look.

This was one of the drafts (now discarded):

This is either my final version, or very close to it. I will work on it some more and try to find some other stuff I can add:

Finished a Fairly Final Copy in Fusion<br>
I finished a near final version of the bed scraper so far. It took me a good amount of time, only because this is my first real project in Fusion. Most of my time went into figuring out how to shape the handle and keep the blade thin without making it too thin or breakable. I also really struggled with keeping the model clean and good looking with a nice fillet. Sketching was also hard to grasp for me when I tried to add new stuff.

The design looks pretty close to what I want, but I couldn't make it curved due to how hard it was in fusion.

Drafted the idea<br>
I came up with the idea of a simple bed scraper today and made a rough layout sketch. I need it because removing prints has been a slow process for me, and the metal tools I normally find online cost a lot of money and leave scratches. I made a draft for it below and am planning to add some custom branding too!

This is my current draft:
